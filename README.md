DS4Windows
==========

A tool to give Sony's DualShock 4 Xinput and more

Built off Electrobrains build, but with different features, such as: 
A profile system - Make Profiles with different settings and mapping for any event you would need it for. 
Revamped touchpad - A single touchpad mode, with areas such as left side, right side, multitouch, and upperpad. 
Auto-Updates - When a new update arrives DS4Tool/DS4Windows will tell you there's an update and update automatically
More mapping options - You can assign mouse movement to all buttons and axis, 4th and 5th mouse button, and most keyboard keys.
And other things I didn't care to list here.

This tool requires a driver to use, however I have not made the driver myself (but is downloaded when installing)

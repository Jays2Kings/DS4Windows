# DS4Windows

The original creator and uploader, Jays2Kings, has stopped providing updates for DS4Windows, meaning this version of DS4 is DEAD. 
The project is continued here: https://github.com/Ryochan7/DS4Windows
Newest version can be found here: https://github.com/Ryochan7/DS4Windows/releases

## Requirements

[Microsoft .NET 4.5 or higher (needed to unzip the driver and for macros to work properly)](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42642)
DS4 Driver (Downloaded & Installed with DS4Windows)
Microsoft 360 Driver (link inside DS4Windows, already installed on Windows 7 SP1 and higher or if you've used a 360 controller before)
Sony DualShock 4 (This should be obvious)
Micro USB cable
(Optional)Bluetooth 2.1+, via adapter or built in pc [(My recommendation)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LNXO28/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (Toshiba's bluetooth & Bluetooth adapters using CSR currently does not work)

Note: Hide DS4 currently doesn't work on Windows 10 without a workaround (disabling Network list service and restarting, but this causes serious issues with windows, use caution)

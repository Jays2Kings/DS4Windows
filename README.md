EAll4Windows
==========
(Emulate All Controllers for Windows)
==========

A tool to emulate the xbox360 controller with multiple controllers, and applies system wide

Built off Jays2Kings' version, which itself was based on Electrobrains' build, but supporting other controllers as well.

Disabling the "Network List Service" may help with getting the exclusive access working.

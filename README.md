# DS4Windows

Like those other ds4tools, but sexier.

DS4Windows is an extract anywhere program that allows you to get the best
DualShock 4 experience on your PC. By emulating a Xbox 360 controller, many
more games are accessible.

This project is a fork of the work of Jays2Kings. You can find the old project
website at [ds4windows.com](http://ds4windows.com).

## Device Detection Issue

If your DS4 is not detected by DS4Windows and the lightbar continues to
flash yellow, there is a chance that Exclusive Mode has permanently
disabled your DS4 in Windows. The easiest way to test if this has happened is
for you to plug in the controller into a different USB port and see if it
works then. Although this problem mainly affected older versions of
DS4Windows (text written after version 1.5.15) for various reasons,
other mapping programs can cause the same problem to occur.

If you suspect that your DS4 has been disabled, open the Device Manager
(Control Panel\Hardware and Sound\Device Manager) and look for devices listed
under the path "Human Interface Devices\HID-compliant game controller".

![Disabled Device Example](https://i.imgur.com/KI3QX2i.png)

If the icon shown for a device has a down arrow icon then you should
check the device's device instance path and see if the device is a
DualShock 4 device. Right click the device item and select "Enable device"
from the menu. That will re-enable the device and be seen by applications
again.

## Disable Steam Controller Mapping Support

With recent updates to the Steam client at the time writing this (2018-12-13),
Steam has enabled Xbox Configuration Support in the Steam client by default.
What this means is that Steam will automatically map a detected Xbox 360
controller to KB+M bindings initially (Desktop Mode) before launching Steam
Big Picture Mode or launching a game. This presents a problem for DS4Windows
since the created virtual Xbox 360 controller will be mapped to KB+M actions
for desktop mode and games launched outside of the Steam client. In order to
use DS4Windows properly, you have to open Steam Big Picture Mode, navigate to
Settings > Controller> Controller Settings and uncheck **Xbox Configuration
Support** along with **PlayStation Configuration Support**.

## Personal Game Testing

My PC game library is not that expansive so there are likely games
that will be tested by users that I will not have access to
playing. There are likely going to be times when I cannot directly test
against a game since I will not have access to play it. Most free to play
games or games that include a playable demo should be fine for testing.
For other games, it might be better if people could test against any game
that I have in my game library and try to reproduce a problem. Here are
links to my Steam and GOG profiles so that people can see what games I have
access to play.
